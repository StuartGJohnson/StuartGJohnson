- 👋 Hi, I’m @StuartGJohnson
- 👀 I’m interested in ...
  - Robotics! especially...
    - Simulation
    - Mobile robots
    - Build up from scratch
    - Various parts of the algorithm stack
    - Robots that function outdoors in (more) natural environments
  - Linear and non-linear controls and tools to develop and understand them:
    - Modelica
    - Simulink
  - Deep learning and deep learning tools, especially:
    - Deep learning with very little data
    - Deep learning with very little labeled data
    - Active learning and data set exploration
    - Other applications for automatic differentiation tools
  - Archaeology and GIS
  - GIS and deep learning
  - Astronomy, both radio and optical
    - Backyard radio astronomy with SDR
    - Photometry and small telescopes
  - All tools to make device and SW engineering more transparent and more maintainable
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
  - Robotics and Autononous Systems via Stanford Graduate courses
  - How to observe variable stars (using AAVSO guides and my own HW/SW)
  - ROS projects
  - How to describe physical systems and implement/simulate/test their control in Modelica
  - How to describe physical systems and implement/simulate/test their control in Simulink
  - How to apply GIS and deep learning to map exploration
  - Autonomous 1/10 scale racing
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
